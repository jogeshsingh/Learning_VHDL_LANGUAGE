   - VHDL ---    VHSIC HDL ---- VERY HIGH SPEED INTEGRATED CIRCUIT HARDWARE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE

   - It's used to decribe digital logic design , especially mostly used for creating RTL Design 

   
## What is an RTL Design ?

-  RTL design ----Register Transfer level

-  it is an abstraction of computer design , where piece of hardware (digital logic) is used to 
   depict the building blocks of electronic (binary 1's and 0's) system , it comprises of various control path (`FSM `) and data path sub blocks 
   which are further categorized in `MUX` , `DEMUX`  , `DECODERS` , `Flip flops` ,
   complex state machines for controlling the flow of data 

## Background of VHDL 

- VHDL was firstly used in U.S department of defense in early 1980's to design digital electronics circuits ,
   and mainly for FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays).

- it includes constructs not typically found in traditional
  programming languages, such as signals, concurrency, and time.
  However, not all of VHDLâ€™s language features are useful for synthesizing digital
  systems, and not all of its useful synthesis features need to be understood before
  simple systems can be designed.

- Language constructs and their syntax and semantics
  are introduced in this book as they are needed.


## Generate statements in VHDL

- In `VHDL` Generate statements has numerous usecases.
- For e.g-: let's say we use `generic` keyword in VHDL

      - Generic ( SYNC_STATGE := 2);
      - HAS_SYNC_STAGES : if SYNC_STAGES = 1 generate

      begin
         SYNC_REG[0] <= I_din ;
         SYNC_REG[1] <= SYNC_REG[0];
      end generate HAS_SYNC_STAGES;
     
      - HAS_NO_SYNC_STAGES : if SYNC_STAGES = 0 generate

          begin
          out_reg <= i_din ;
          end generate HAS_NO_SYNC_STAGES ;

## SIGNALS Vs Variable


## Some Important keywords in VHDL


  - `Task to be done -: `
  - `MAKE A Configurable ASYNCHRONOUS_FIFO in VHDL`
  - `DO its timing analysis`
 
  - [UART](https://github.com/alialaei110/HDLab-FPGA-Development-Board/blob/master/Example-Projects/VHDL_Module/UART/UART.vhd)
  - Do its simulation
  - Then implement your own 
  - Chekc compiler directives `if_def` in `Digital System Design using Verilog by Charles Roth`
  - Check Functions and Task in above book
  - Check Fixed and floating point arithmetic topic (search , learn from videos)
  - Implement fixed point adder and floating point adder
