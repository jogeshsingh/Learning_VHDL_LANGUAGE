- VHDL ---    VHSIC HDL ---- VERY HIGH SPEED INTEGRATED CIRCUIT HARDWARE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE

     - It's used to decribe digital logic design , especially mostly used for creating RTL Design 

   
## What is an RTL Design ?

RTL design ----Register Transfer level
-- it is an abstraction of computer design , where microarchitecture is used to 
   depict the building blocks of digital electronic system it comprises , of control path and data path sub blocks 
   which are further categorized in MUX , DEMUX  , DECODERS , Flip flops ,
   complex state machines for controlling the flow of data 



## Background of VHDL 

-- VHDL was firstly used in U.S department of defense in early 1980's to design digital electronics circuits ,
-- and mainly for FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays).


< <---------------------------------->
VHDL is a complex language; it includes constructs not typically found in traditional
programming languages, such as signals, concurrency, and time.
However, not all of VHDLâ€™s language features are useful for synthesizing digital
systems, and not all of its useful synthesis features need to be understood before
simple systems can be designed. Language constructs and their syntax and semantics
are introduced in this book as they are needed.
